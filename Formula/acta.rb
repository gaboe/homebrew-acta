  # Regenerate this whenever the binary changes: `packaging/release.sh` prints it, and both the
  # binary and the archive are reproducible, so the same commit always gives the same value.
  # The archive only became reproducible once the script stopped letting gzip stamp the time of
  # compression into its header — until then a rebuild of one commit gave a new SHA every time,
  # and the mismatch would have surfaced as a failed install rather than as an error at release.
